## Content:

In this module, we cover key components to consider when experimenting and building new Machine Learning models. We'll cover areas such as:
- Families of algorithms based on type of problem.
- Experiment tracking and logging.
- Using Explainable Boosted Machines.
- Creating Machine Learning Models using Auto ML.
- Model interpretation
- Model assumption validation. 
- Model Review Process.

We are going to answer those questions by focusing in each of the following stages in the data ingestion process:
