# Topic 5: Model Creation: Avoiding Risks Associated with Model Creation & Selection. Tabular Data.

Welcome to this topic!

## Come prepared!  

**Recommended Preparation:** We recommend going through the following content. 

- [Where and how to deploy into Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-and-where)
- [Detect data drift on models deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-data-drift)
- [Train and deploy ML models at scale using Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/azure-databricks/amlsdk/build-model-run-history-03.ipynb)
- [Confidential ML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Confidential-ML?term=confidential%20ml&lang-en=true)
- [Confidential Machine Learning Deep-Dive](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Confidential-Machine-Learning-Deep-Dive?term=confidential%20ml&lang-en=true)

## Content:

In this module, we cover how to go from a script or notebook with your working model to a production-ready model deployment.
- Defining environment dependencies.
- How to create images with Web Services.
- How to write tests for your model.
- Defining an API and schema for your deployed model.
- How to set up a test environment and debug and test your model
- How to deploy your model to a test environment
- Model Review Process.
- How to understand and mitigate deployment risk 
- Data drift detection 




We are going to answer those questions by focusing in each of the following stages in the data ingestion process:
