# Topic 1: Data ingestion: Avoiding Risks Associated with Data Acquisition

Welcome to this topic!

## Come prepared!  

**GitHub training**: We recommend understanding the [Basics of GitHub](https://lab.github.com/)

## Content:

How do you coordinate workflows enabling data science teams to work together and make sure that everything becomes a shared asset. This module focuses on using Issues, Pull Requests, and a coherent branching strategy to enable teams to work together in a way that is familiar to both data scientists and engineers. Using this asynchronous, issue-first pattern, we allow everyone to work how they are comfortable while enabling teams to work as one team and not just as a collection of individuals. The concepts learned in this module will be used throughout the rest of the series when working through the actual use cases.
- Issue Driven Workflows
- Issue Templates and Labels
- Data Science Branching Strategy
