# Topic 3: Model objective validation: avoiding risks associated with design objectives of Machine Learning models.

Welcome to this topic!

## Come prepared!  

**Video Lecture:** We recommend going through the following content. 

- [Explainable Boosted Machines (EBMs) Build Presentation](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/The-Science-Behind-InterpretML-Explainable-Boosting-Machine?term=Explainable%20boosted%20machines&lang-en=true)
- [Microsoft InterpretML and EBMs](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret)
- [Pandas profiling documentation](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)

## Content:

In this module, we are going to focus on evaluating the quality of the input data. We are going to do this from the Model Risk and fairness points of view. At the end of the sessions, the attendants will understand how to avoid risks associated with the training data. More in details, they will learn:

- How to determine the right set of metrics according to your business problem. 
- How to build a baseline by using the defined metrics.
- How to identify weaknesses on the dataset. Evaluating fairness and representation on dataset. 
- How to determine quality samples vs. target. i.e. miss-labeled samples.
- How to determine your Dev/Test strategies to ensure robustness of evaluation.
- Build baseline models.
- How to identify cases where you need to enrich dataset.


We are going to answer those questions by focusing in each of the following stages in the data ingestion process:
